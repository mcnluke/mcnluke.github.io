    <p>Our glorius Lord of Carrots, Donald J Trump (colloquially known as DJ Trump, The Trumpenator and strangely also Laos) has recently had an absolutely HORRIBLE seizure after watching a highly disturbinging video of a rabbit eating carrots. This disgusing specimen of a rabbit has now been targeted by our king DJ Trump. When asked on the issue he releasied the following statement: "When i'm President, that bunny will be dead!". Mr Trump's office also released some disturbing pictures of the rabbit going into various different death machines and being executed.  </p>

<p> A spokesrabbit for the United Nations Commission into Rabbit Safety, Kingston Rabbeet, responded to Holy Trumps statement: "The images Mr Trump has released are very disturbing. But we have to say this to Mr Trump: When we see you eating pork we vomit, because you are a cannibal. You are a pig Mr Trump A PIG!"</p>
    <h1>Wow that was dramatic.</h1>
